We propose a model-based method for fully cooperative multi-agent settings (Dec-POMDPs). Our method learns a centralized model, and is up to 20x more sample efficient in three commuication tasks. We also show theoretical sample complexity bounds for model-based methods learning in tabular Dec-POMDPs.
