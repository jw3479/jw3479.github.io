We introduce and study, in both the marriage and the roommate case, inclusionwise maximal internally stable sets of matchings. We call those sets internally closed. By building on known and newly developed algebraic structures associated to sets of matchings, we investigate the complexity of deciding if a set of matchings is internally closed, and if it is von Neumann-Morgenstern stable.
