We tackle the problem of uncertainty quantification of demographic disparity estimates when the demographic labels are unobserved. We propose a dual-bootstrap approach that explicitly accounts for imputation error, enabling inference that is valid asymptotically. Empirically, we show through simulated data that dual bootstrap produces more accurate predictions in finite samples.
