Representations of Lie algebras have found many applications in combinatorics following work by Richard Stanley. Inspired by the study of two-colored diagonal Ramsey numbers, we construct linear operators acting on graphs by recoloring complete monochromatic subgraphs. We present computational evidence for semisimplicity and stabilization of the Lie algebras.
